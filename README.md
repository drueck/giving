#Giving

Giving is a web application designed for churches or other non-profits
who need a very simple way to track contributions and generate annual 
giving statements.

##Adding a Batch of Contributions
- Click on Current Batch from the main menu, or Contributions, Current Batch
  from the top menu. This will bring you to a list of all pending contributions,
  which should initially be empty.
- Add each contribution using the form at the top of the page, following the
  instructions in Adding a Contribution below.
- When you have added all the contributions you need to and the everything looks
  correct, click Post Contributions, which will post all the contributions you 
  just added and bring you to a screen that lists everything that was posted.
- Click Batch Report PDF for a PDF version that you can save or print if needed.

##Adding a Contribution
- Select the Contributor by beginning to type in her name. Matches should start
  popping up. Select the correct contributor when  she shows up in the list. 
  If the contributor does not show up, you will need to add her to the Contributors
  list by following the instructions in Adding a Contributor below.
- Select the contribution date using the calendar control, or by typing it in in MM/DD/YYYY format.
- Enter the amount, select the payment type, and optionally enter a reference, such as a check number.
- Hit <ENTER> or click Add to add the contribution to the batch.

##Adding a Contributor
- Click Contributors on the top menu.
- Click New Contributor at the bottom of that screen.
- Fill in all the fields, leaving the Household Name blank unless it is needed. The 
  household name should be used like the following example: There are two contributors, Ken Rueck and Mary Jo Rueck who are husband and wife and who live in the same household. They should each have their own entry in the Contributors list, but in both of those entries, the household name should be something like Ken & Mary Jo Rueck. This can be used to group their contributions together for annual giving statements, etc.
- Click Save.

##Viewing Previously Posted Batches
- Click on Contributions, Previous Batches from the top menu to list all previously
  posted batches. From there you can click on any of the batches to see the contributions
  posted on them or to save or print a PDF Batch Report.

##Editing Contributor Details or Contributions
- Click on Contributors on the top menu. To find a contributor without scrolling through
  all of them, you can use the search field at the top of that screen. You can enter the
  contributor's first name, last name or full name and hit enter or click Search to filter
  the list. (Note: If you click search with no name in the search box, it will show all
  contributors again). Once you have found the contributor you're looking for, click on
  his name. This will bring you to a screen where you can edit his information, view his
  contributions and if necessary correct a contribution.

##Managing Individual Contributions
- If you need to post an individual contribution outside of a batch (though that is not
  preferred) or edit one that you recently posted and that was incorrect, you can do both
  of those things by going to Contributions, All Posted Contributions from the main menu.
